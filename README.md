### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Le Phan!

An IT Specialist currently working for Naval Sea Systems Command, Port Hueneme Divison. Looking to make the leap into Cybersecurity.
You can take a look at projects I have been working on in the <b>Cybersecutity Projects</b> section. I also have a [blog](https://www.lvphan.xyz) that I try to write to about my experiences and interests relating to Cybersecurity to further develop my writing skills.

### 🧰 Toolbox
I have some familiarity with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python. Enough to potentially write some small scripts and to understand.
