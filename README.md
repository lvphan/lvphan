### 👨‍💻 Cybersecurity Projects:</h2>
 - [LeToolbox 🧰](lvphan.github.io/LeToolbox) is a combination of a bunch of tools that I use during my daily tasking combined into a single location. Instead of navigating multiple tabs to copy-paste information for OSINT, I made it my one-stop shop. The code is generated from the free version of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude with slight modifications made by me.
